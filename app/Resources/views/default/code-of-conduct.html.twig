        <p>South Dakota Code Camp is a community conference intended for networking and
            collaboration in the developer community.</p>

        <p>We value the participation of each member of the SFDevs community and want all attendees
            to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected
            to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all
            conference events, whether officially sponsored by SFDevs or not.</p>

        <p>To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors,
            organizers and volunteers at any SFDevs event are required to conform to the following
            Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>

        <h2>The Short Version</h2>

        <p>South Dakota Code Camp is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
            for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
            appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
            participants in any form.</p>

        <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of
            many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
            conference venue, including talks.</p>

        <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally.
            Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate
            for South Dakota Code Camp.</p>

        <p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund
            at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.</p>

        <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>

        <h2>The Longer Version</h2>

        <p>Harassment includes offensive communication related to gender, sexual orientation,
            disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public
            spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
            recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
            contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
            immediately.</p>

        <p>Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also
            subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use
            sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers)
            should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized
            environment.</p>

        <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other
            exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and
            offensive jokes are not appropriate for South Dakota Code Camp.</p>

        <p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference
            organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
            or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
